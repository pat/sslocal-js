# SSLocal

SSLocal helps to make running SSL in your local Webpack development environment as streamlined as possible.

Please **do not use this package in production environments** - it's only meant for local development.

## Installation

1. Install [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)
2. Add `config/certificates` to your application's `.gitignore` file.
3. Add this package to your application's `package.json` - ideally just for the development environment.

```json
"devDependencies": {
  // ...
  "@pat/sslocal": "~0.1",
  // ...
}
```

4. If you're using Webpacker and a Rails application, edit `config/webpack/development.js` to apply SSLocal's logic:

```js
// replace
const environment = require('./environment')

// with
const sslocal = require('@pat/sslocal')
const environment = sslocal.apply(require('./environment'))
```

5. Otherwise, use the same approach wherever else you're generating your Webpack configuration. (If you have ideas on how to improve this, please do get in touch!)

## Usage

1. Ensure the `config/certificates` folder exists (`mkdir -p config/certificates`).
2. Generate the local certificate via `mkcert`:

```sh
mkcert --cert-file config/certificates/development.crt \
  --key-file config/certificates/development.key \
  localhost 127.0.0.1
```

3. Boot your Webpack dev server, and it should automatically use SSL using the generated certificate files.

If you're using SSLocal with a Rails app and Webpacker, you'll almost certainly want to install and set up [the SSLocal library for Ruby](https://github.com/pat/sslocal-rb) as well to keep matching protocols.

If you want to switch back to HTTP, just delete the certificate files and restart your Webpack server. The certificate files are not precious, and can be deleted/regenerated as much as you like.
